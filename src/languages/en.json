I am a naturally friendly person who can talk about everything and nothing. I started my programming journey with web development, and currently, I write complex full-stack applications.",
    "experience_title": "Professional life",
    "experience_text": "I started my first job in the profession iun April 2022 as a full-stack developer.

    "hobby_text_programming": "I've been interested in programming for several years now, mainly because I can create something without the need for various physical materials, only relying on knowledge and skills. I especially love creating user-friendly interfaces with interesting animations.",
    "hobby_text_ai": "I don't have much experience with artificial intelligence in terms of coding. I acquired my current knowledge during my studies, where I learned artificial intelligence search patterns and scikit-learn algorithms.In my free time, I try to continue my course on artificial intelligence. What sparked my interest? I believe that artificial intelligence has the potential to accelerate certain processes or make them easier for us, such as information retrieval. And as we know, everyone likes it when it's easier.",
    "hobby_text_cloud": "I had contact with the cloud during the AWS course, and privately, I set up programs or servers on Oracle Cloud. I'm curious about how it looks from the perspective of source code and what the architecture planning looks like.",

    "cpp_text": "In C++ / C, I am a beginner when it comes to projects, and I mostly play around with it rather than creating something larger. I had the opportunity to work on slightly larger projects in this language during my studies. The first one was related to metaheuristics, where everyone had to choose a problem and implement a genetic algorithm for it. My problem was the subset sum problem. The second project involved writing sockets for file exchange.",
    "python_text": "I use Python most often. Mainly because it's a truly powerful language with vast capabilities. I've had experience with frameworks like Django, FastAPI, and Flask. I often use helpful tools like Pandas, which makes tasks like reading Excel or CSV files easier, for example.",
